# ControlFlowGraphDominator
The Dominator program produces dominator sets for all nodes in a connected digraph The dominator of the start node is the start node itself. The set of dominators for any other node n is the intersection of the set of dominators for all predecessors p of n. The node n is also in the set of dominators for n. private Map&lt;Character, Set&lt;Character>> preds contains immediate predecessors of * all the nodes. Just in the case of root node, it is also an immediate predecessor of itself.
